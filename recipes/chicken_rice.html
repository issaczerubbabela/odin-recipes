    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a famous dish here in India. Or atleast opposite to my college here at Thanjavur. This is one of few good foods that the restaurants here serve. Chicken Fried Rice is spicy with a reddish orange color to it. It has small evenly cut pieces of chicken all over it. The shops near my college barely put 10 pieces of these fried chicken in your fried rice though. It's still better than many other food that you can get there. According to me Green Chilly serves the best chicken fried rice but my friends would disagree. They point is that Green Leaf gives you more in quantity. But we all know quality always matter over quantity.</p>
