    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This might be one of my most famous dish among the ones available in the shops opposite to my college. They taste better than the chicken rice and cost the same as the rice. It's really good at Green Chilly especially at Afternoons and when it's a fresh batch and soft. It's usually fresh and soft at Green Chilly but sometimes it's not. Those times it is kind of half cooked at some places, hard to chew but still taste good. Just like how it was with Chicken Rice, it is served in more quantity in the Green Leaf but taste better at Green Chilly.</p>
    <p>Now take the recipe that I copied from the web and leave.</p>
